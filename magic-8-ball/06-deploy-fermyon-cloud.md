## Custom Domains

Fermyon Cloud also provides a way for you to use your own domain names to provide your users with human-friendly access to your Spin applications. If you do not own a domain, you can purchase one through a domain registrar such as Namecheap and GoDaddy and then point your Spin application to the new custom domain. [This tutorial](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud/custom-domains-tutorial) runs you through the steps to apply a custom domain to your Spin application running on Fermyon Cloud.
