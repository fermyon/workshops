# Creating a Magic AIght Ball JSON API with Spin with Fermyon Serverless AI

Instead of being limited by a set of 20 predefined responses, we can use AI inferencing to generate a unique response that is catered to our questions.

Spin now supports running inferencing requests with Language Learning Models (LLMs) with SDK support
for Rust and TS/JS apps. Furthermore, you can test your Spin app locally and then deploy it to
Cloud, which hosts its own LLM for handling inferencing.

This section will walk through how to modify your JSON API to use responses from an LLM instead of a
hard coded list.

As with the previous steps, you can choose to build the app in either Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, or Go.

> Note that Fermyon Cloud support is currently in private beta. To apply for access to the private beta, please fill out [this survey](https://fibsu0jcu2g.typeform.com/serverless-ai).

To get started with Fermyon Serverless AI, follow [these instructions](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/serverless-ai-tutorial) to make sure you have installed the correct version of Spin and the necessary SDKs. If you'd like to learn more about the API, visit the [API guide here](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/serverless-ai-api-guide).

## a. Building your Magic AI Ball application with Rust

We need to modify our `magic-8-ball` component to:

1. Get a yes/no question from the body of the HTTP request
2. Use the `Llm.infer_with_options` function Spin `Llm` library to generate a response to the question

First, update the request handler to get the question from the request body and return an error if
the body is empty:

```rs
fn handle_magic_8_ball(req: Request) -> Result<Response> {
    let body = req.body().as_deref().unwrap_or_default();
    let question = std::str::from_utf8(&body)?;
    if question.is_empty() {
        return Ok(http::Response::builder()
        .status(200)
        .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .body(Some("No question provided".into()))?);
    }
    ...
```

Next, let's update the `answer` function to use the LLM instead of pulling a random response from a
list. First, we need to make sure we are using the canary Spin SDK, which has support for the `llm` crate. Update the dependency tag in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
spin-sdk = { git = "https://github.com/fermyon/spin", tag = "v1.5.0" }
```

Now, back in your application (`lib.rs`), you can get the `llm` module from the Spin Rust SDK:

```rs
use spin_sdk::llm;
```

Update the `answer` function use the `llm::infer_with_options` function, specifying which model you have configured Spin to
use and a prompt. We will use the default `Llama2Chat` model, which you can download later or use in Fermyon Cloud. The
prompt should tell the system what type of responses it should give along with the user provided
question. Your `answer` function should look similar to the following:

```rs
fn answer(question: &str) -> Result<String> {
    let prompt = format!(
        r"<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
        You are acting as a Magic 8 Ball that predicts the answer to a questions about events now or in the future.
        Your tone should be expressive yet polite.
        Your answers should be 10 words or less.
        Prefix your response with 'Answer:'.
        <</SYS>>
        {question}[/INST]"
    );

    // Set model to default Llama2 or the one configured in runtime-config.toml
    let model = llm::InferencingModel::Llama2Chat;
    let answer = llm::infer_with_options(
        model,
        &prompt,
        llm::InferencingParams {
            max_tokens: 20,
            repeat_penalty: 1.5,
            repeat_penalty_last_n_token_count: 20,
            temperature: 0.25,
            top_k: 5,
            top_p: 0.25,
        },
    )?
    .text;
    let mut answer = answer.trim();
    while let Some(a) = answer.strip_prefix("Answer:") {
        answer = a.trim();
    }
    Ok(answer.trim().to_string())
}
```

> Note: The `llm::infer` function can be used in the request if you want to use the default options.

Now, build your application and see the [deploy to Fermyon Cloud section](#deploy-to-cloud) to test it out.

```bash
spin build
```

## b. Building your Magic 8 Ball application with TypeScript

We need to modify our `magic-8-ball` component to:

1. Reference a local LLM model
1. Get a yes/no question from the body of the HTTP request
1. Use the `Llm.infer` function Spin `Llm` library to generate a response to the question


First, update the request handler to get the question from the request body and return an error if
the body is empty:

```ts
  const question = decoder.decode(request.body)
  if (question.length == 0) {
    return {
      status: 400,
      body: encoder.encode("No question asked").buffer
    }
  }
```

Next, update the `answer` function to use the LLM instead of pulling a random response from a list.
Use the `Llm.infer` function, passing in a prompt to tell the system what type of responses it
should give along with the user provided question.

```ts
function answer(question: string): string {
  const prompt =  `<s>[INST] <<SYS>>
        You are acting as a Magic 8 Ball that predicts the answer to a questions about events now or in the future.
        Your tone should be expressive yet polite.
        Your answers should be 10 words or less.
        Prefix your response with 'Answer:'.
        <</SYS>>
        User: ${question}[/INST]"`;
  let response = Llm.infer(InferencingModels.Llama2Chat, prompt, {
	  maxTokens: 20,
	  repeatPenalty: 1.5,
	  repeatPenaltyLastNTokenCount: 20,
	  temperature: 0.25,
	  topK: 5,
	  topP: 0.25,
	}).text
  // Parse the response to remove the expected `Answer:` prefix from the response
  const answerPrefix = "Answer:"
  response = response.trim()
  if(response.startsWith(answerPrefix)) {
    response = response.substring(answerPrefix.length)
  }
  return response
}
```

Now, build your application.

```bash
npm install
spin build
```

## Configure access to an AI model

By default, a given component of a Spin application will not have access to any Serverless AI models. Access must be provided explicitly via the Spin applicationâ€™s manifest (the `spin.toml` file). We can give our `magic-8` component access to the llama2-chat model by adding the following ai_models configuration inside its `[[component]]` section:

```toml
[[component]]
id = "magic-8-ball"
ai_models = ["llama2-chat"]
```

## Deploy to Cloud

Let's deploy our Serverless AI application to Fermyon Cloud with the following command:

```bash
spin cloud deploy
```

> Note: If this is the first time you interact with the cloud, you will be asked to [sign up using GitHub](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud/quickstart#log-in-to-the-fermyon-cloud).
> For the AI Inferencing to work, you'll also need access to the [Private Beta feature in Cloud](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud/serverless-ai).

Let's ask a question (make sure to use your Spin application's domain name, discoverable on [Fermyon Cloud UI](https://cloud.fermyon.com))

```bash
$ curl -d "Will I win the lottery?" https://{url}/magic-8
{"answer": "Signs point to yes!"}  
```

## (Optional) Run Locally

We can run the inferencing requests locally, but the model needed is a large download, and the inferencnig takes a long time to run. We should expect tens of seconds for each request.

Before we run our application locally, we must first download a LLM. The following steps show how to
download Llama 2, the model used in Fermyon Cloud. This has the benefit of being a stronger model
and a consistent local to Cloud experience; however, the model is quite large (6GB). Alternatively,
you can install a smaller LLM model and configure Spin to use it with a runtime config file. The
model should be placed in the `.spin/ai-models` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .spin/ai-models
wget https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGML/resolve/main/llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin
mv llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q3_K_L.bin .spin/ai-models/llama2-chat
```

Now, we can build and run your Magic AI Ball!

```bash
spin build --up
```

Let's ask a question

```bash
$ curl -d "Will I win the lottery?" http://127.0.0.1:3000/magic-8
{"answer": "Signs point to yes!"}  
```

> Note: you can find the complete applications used in this workshop in the [`apps`
> directory](./apps/).
