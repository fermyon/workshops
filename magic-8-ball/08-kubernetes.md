# Magic K8s Ball

We can also run our Magic 8 Ball Spin application on Kubernetes using a [Wasm `containerd` shim](https://github.com/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/blob/main/containerd-shim-spin-v1/quickstart.md). This exercise is a continuation of [exercise 5](./05-spin-kv.md). For more documentation on Spin on Kubernetes, see Spin's [developer documentation](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/kubernetes).

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you need to have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) version 4.13.1 (90346) or later with [containerd enabled](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/containerd/)
- [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.6/#installation)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [Spin binary and templates](https://spin.fermyon.dev/quickstart/)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Start and configure a k3d cluster

Start a k3d cluster with the wasm shims already installed:

```bash
k3d cluster create wasm-cluster --image ghcr.io/deislabs/containerd-wasm-shims/examples/k3d:v0.8.0 -p "8081:80@loadbalancer" --agents 2
```

Apply RuntimeClass for spin applications to use the Spin containerd Wasm shim:

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
kind: RuntimeClass
metadata:
  name: "wasmtime-spin-v1"
handler: "spin"
EOF
```

## Package your Spin app inside a container

We will use an experimental [Spin K8s plugin](https://github.com/chrismatteson/spin-plugin-k8s) to package our Spin application inside a Container. While Spin supports packaging Spin applications as OCI artifacts with `spin registry`, currently, the `containerd-wasm-shim` expects the Wasm modules to be inside a container. The shim then pulls the module outside of the container when the application is deployed to the cluster. In the future, the shim may support Spin application OCI artifacts, reducing the steps needed to deploy your Spin application to a cluster.

The plugin requires that all modules are available locally and that files are within subdirectories of the working directory. In particular, we need to get the static fileserver module, move our frontend files within this directory, and update our component manifest with the new resource paths.

```bash

curl -LRO https://github.com/fermyon/spin-fileserver/releases/download/v0.0.1/spin_static_fs.wasm
cp -r spin/apps/frontend .
```

Update your `fileserver` component manifest:

```
[[component]]
source = "spin_static_fs.wasm"
id = "fileserver"
files = [ { source = "frontend/", destination = "/" } ]
[component.trigger]
route = "/..."
```

Install the plugin, scaffold the dockerfile, build the container, and push it to your container registry. The following example uses the [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry). Since each application gets its own key value store, but there is a load balancer balancing requests, we only want one deployment replica. **Be sure to modify the `deploy.yaml` to set `replicas` to `1`.

> Note: To skip building your own container and instead use an existing public one, first copy a pre-scaffolded `deploy.yaml` from the completed apps directory like so: `cp apps/07-kubernetes/magic-8-ball-rust/deploy.yaml .` Then, proceed with the `spin k8s deploy` step.

```bash
# Install the plugin
$ spin plugin install -y -u https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrismatteson/spin-plugin-k8s/main/k8s.json
# Build your app locally
$ spin build

# Scaffold your Dockerfile, passing in the namespace of your registry
$ spin k8s scaffold ghcr.io/my-registry  && spin k8s build
# UPDATE resultant deploy.yaml to have 1 replica to use only one KV store

# Push the container to your container registry
$ spin k8s push ghcr.io/my-registry

# After making sure it is a publicly accessible container or adding a regcred to your `deploy.yaml`
$ spin k8s deploy

# Watch the applications become ready
$ kubectl get pods --watch
```

> To learn more about each of the `k8s` plugin steps, see the [documentation on running Spin on Kubernetes](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/kubernetes).

Now, spin your Magic 8 Ball at `http://0.0.0.0:8081/`.

## Cleanup

Bring down your `k3d` cluster:

```bash
k3d cluster delete wasm-cluster
```
