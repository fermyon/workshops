The first module will guide you through installing the prerequisites for completing the first part of this workshop.

## Configuring your local environment for Spin

First, you have to install and configure [Spin](https://fermyon.com/spin) by following the [instructions for your operating system from the Spin documentation](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/install). This workshop assumes you're using Spin `2.5.1`. You can check your version of Spin, by running `spin -V`.

To complete the exercises of this workshop, you must have the following Spin plugins and templates installed:

- `cloud`
- `py2wasm`

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
# Update Spin Plugin information
$ spin plugins update

# Install required Spin plugins
$ spin plugins install cloud
$ spin plugins install py2wasm
```

Depending on the programming languages you want to use, you will need to configure their [toolchains](https://developer.fermyon.com/spin/v2/quickstart#install-the-tools). For example:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
  - Make sure to add the Wasm/WASI target: `rustup target install wasm32-wasi`
- [TypeScript](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
  - Also requires [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install)

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I cannot build my Rust application with `spin build`.

A: Make sure you have [configured your Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and have added the `wasm32-wasi` target using `rustup target add wasm32-wasi`.

### Q: I cannot build my JavaScript or TypeScript application with `spin build`.

A: Make sure you have [configured Node.js and `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), and that you have executed `npm install` in the directory with your component's `package.json` file that contains the dependencies.
